## ✨ About this repo
Welcome — this repo is a personal note collection for TryHackMe rooms I solve.  
I keep concise write-ups, commands used, key learnings, and flags (where not allowed). This helps me revise techniques, create walkthroughs, and showcase learning progress.

**Goals**
- ✅ Keep notes clear & reproducible  
- ✅ Save important commands and commands output snippets  
- ✅ Link to each completed room and highlight techniques used  
- ✅ Build a study archive for interviews & CTF prep
